# stream-most Monadic Streams Implementation
One of my most loved Projects @mostjs/core and mostjs they are great for large scale modules that need to handle a lot of transactional logic.
With confidence. In general Components the WebStream Implementations are better in general is a stream a form of composeable iterators that loop.
The most implementation does that with a functional pattern and util functions to reach the goal of writing less to archive more 
in a highly complex system this gets for example used to implement cpu scheduler abstractions for the host or hardware layer components.

they do not implement any backpresure and are not well for that so they are ideal for system tasks which also accept no backpressure they happen or
they do not happen thats the nature of things.
