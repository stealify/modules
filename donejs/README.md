# DoneJS / CanJS
The most complet full Integrated Frameworks ever done. Until now. Out of Historical Reasons it is designed to run on IE6.
There exists a more modern web component based version of canjs but that is missing all the cool donejs integrations.

This project trys to offer DoneJS again as a Serieres of Modules driven from the CanJS Api's but implemented with Nativ Concepts.
Also Replacing Stache by Tagged Template String Composition or Literal Templates.

Bindings do not exist if you want to bind values for later reuse in your code you can simply compose that into your template.

that saves a lot of reading and coding effort in smaller projects while it also keeps big projects maintainable which consist out of 
small units eg: Modlets a core principle of the whole modules ecosystem while i was aware of that pattern it was not well defined as
a pattern bitovi the creators of DoneJS CanJS did a great job teaching fundamentals and improving the concepts of integrated build
Environments. They where pioneers from the start on with projects like jQuery++ and Customers like Apple which in fact maintain the 
most used Rendering Engine in the World Webkit.
